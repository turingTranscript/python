## Lab 9: Initial Data Exploration - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Basics

**Symptom Analysis:** You have compiled a list of reported symptoms observed in a larger sample of affected South Asian River Dolphins across different river segments. You need to identify the most frequently occurring symptoms to understand the primary indicators of the disease.

**Problem:** Write a Python script to read the list of symptoms. Use dictionaries to count the frequency of each unique symptom. Print the top three most frequent symptoms observed in the affected dolphin population.

### Worksheet:

1.  Create a list of reported symptoms from affected South Asian River Dolphins: `['lethargy', 'skin lesions', 'respiratory distress', 'loss of appetite', 'abnormal swimming']`.
2.  Create an empty dictionary to store symptom counts.
3.  Iterate through the list of symptoms. For each symptom, increment its count in the dictionary.
4.  Sort the dictionary by value (frequency) in descending order.
5.  Print the top three symptoms and their counts.
